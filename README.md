## Overview

We present a k-space cold diffusion model for accelerated MRI reconstruction. Different from previous diffusion-based models for MRI reconstruction that utilized Gaussian noise, our model performs degradation in k-space during the diffusion process. A deep neural network is trained to perform the reverse process to recover the original fully sampled image. In such a way, the k-space sampling process is integrated directly into the image degradation process, enhancing the modelâ€™s generalizability, especially when the sampling process is similar. This allows for quicker application and better performance in zero-shot or few-shot learning scenarios.
